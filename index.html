            <p>
              Currently I work as a Technical Consultant at <a href="https://www.sopheon.com">Sopheon</a>, based in Maastricht. I will translate the needs and requirements of the client into the right configuration and will make customizations to our Accolade product if that is desired. In this I am also an advisor on what the best practices are and how to keep the confituration future-proof. All of this requires me one day to be knee-deep in javascript, C# or SQL code, the next day to create complicated Excel documents to create reports and the day after to sit down with the client to design the system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Software engineering is my true love though. Nothing beats sitting down and coding for hours, hitting Run at the end and seeing that you got it right off the bat (or at least close). I have an interest in automating things as much as possible, leaning against DevOps. Things like Continuous Delivery and automated test running make sure that I can spend more time on actually creating new things, instead of doing deploys manually (with all risks included) or hunting for silly bugs that could have been avoided.
            </p>
          <h5>Education</h5>
            <p>
              In 2009 I got my Bachelors degree of Science in Information Technology at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). In 2012 I graduated from the TU/e with the degree of Master of Science in Business Information Systems. During these great years I participated in several boards and commissions, including the <a href="http://essf.nl/index.php/nl/">ESSF</a>, basketball club <a href="http://tantalus-basketbal.nl/">Tantalus</a> and rowing club <a href="https://esrtheta.nl/">Thêta</a>
            </p>
          <h5>Free time</h5>
            <p>Philosophical question: does a dad truly have any free time? Just kidding of course :). I like spending time with my family, taking walks with my dog, riding my motorcycle, reading about science and technology and listening to heavy metal (not necessarily in that order). I also have an interesting in cooking and tasting as many beers as possible</p>
