          <h5>Career</h5>
            <p>
              I currently work as a Technical Consultant at <a href="https://www.sopheon.com">Sopheon</a>, based in Maastricht. I will translate the needs and requirements of the client into the right configuration and will make customizations to our Accolade product if desired. I am also an advisor on what the best practices are and how to keep the confituration upgrade-proof. All of this requires me one day to be knee-deep in javascript, C# or SQL code, the next day to create complicated Excel documents to generate financial reports and the day after to sit down with the client to design the system. It also expects me to know how our software works into detail and be able to identify the root cause of problems from either the configuration or from the core product.
            </p>
            <p>
              Software engineering is my true love. Nothing beats sitting down and coding, thinking and refactoring for hours, hitting Run at the end and seeing that you got it right off the bat (or at least close). I have an interest in automating things as much as possible, make the computers work for me. Things like Continuous Delivery and automated test running make sure that I can spend more time on actually creating new things, instead of doing deploys manually (with all risks included), hunting for silly bugs that could have been avoided or repetitive administration.
            </p>
          <h5>Education</h5>
            <p>
              In 2009 I got my Bachelors of Science degree in Information Technology at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). In 2012 I graduated from the TU/e with the degree of Master of Science in Business Information Systems. During these great years I participated in several boards and commissions, including the <a href="http://essf.nl/index.php/nl/">ESSF</a>, basketball club <a href="http://tantalus-basketbal.nl/">Tantalus</a> and rowing club <a href="https://esrtheta.nl/">Thêta.</a>
            </p>
          <h5>Free time</h5>
            <p>Philosophical question: does a dad truly have any free time? Just kidding of course :). I like spending time with my family, taking walks with my dog, riding my motorcycle, reading about science and technology and listening to heavy metal (not necessarily in that order). I also have an interesting in cooking and tasting as many beers as possible.</p>

      <!-- Hi, interesting that you're seeing this :). There is nothing much here. You can check out how I built this page. Although most of the HTML is by hand,
      I used a simple CSS framework (skeleton) for positioning the text and generic styling. FontAwesome for using fancy, scalable icons. No Javascript, since
      this is a static page and I don't need something to drag down the performance! -->
